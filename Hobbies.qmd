Some of my favorite things to do are explore the different hiking trails around Santa Barbara and go on runs. My favorite hikes include the Gaviota Wind Caves, Tangerine Falls, and the Montecito Hot Springs Trail. Living in Isla Vista makes it super convenient to run to the beach, and I often frequent the North Campus Open Space trail that leads to the bluffs at Ellwood. I try to run with friends whenever they're around—it makes it so much more fun, and a little competitive. 
I'm currently training for the Malibu Half Marathon in November, and I hope to run a full marathon in 2026!

## Concerts

Going to concerts with friends is one of my favorite things to do! I love the sense of community at live shows. The environment is always so fun and welcoming. Below are some of my favorite concerts that I’ve been to with family and friends.
Some of my bucket list artists to see live include Kacey Musgraves, Taylor Swift, and Charli XCX.
