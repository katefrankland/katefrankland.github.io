Iâ€™m really looking forward to whatâ€™s ahead and have created an interactive map showing the places Iâ€™ll be traveling to in 2025 and 2026.\nRight now, Iâ€™m in Santa Barbara for school. This summer (2025), Iâ€™ll be moving to Redlands, California for an internship at ESRI. Afterward, Iâ€™ll return to Santa Barbara for Fall Quarter, and in February 2026, Iâ€™ll head to the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia to finish my undergraduate education. Iâ€™ll come back to Santa Barbara for graduation, and then hope to spend the next summer job hunting and exploring in New York City â€” a place Iâ€™ve dreamed of living since I was little. It is going to be completely out of my comfort zone, but am going to push through this and live life to the fullest while I still can."

My favorite hikes include the Gaviota Wind Caves, Tangerine Falls, and the Montecito Hot Springs Trail. Living in Isla Vista makes it super convenient to run to the beach, and I often frequent the North Campus Open Space trail that leads to the bluffs at Ellwood. I try to run with friends whenever theyâ€™re aroundâ€”it makes it so much more fun, and a little competitive. Iâ€™m currently training for the Malibu Half Marathon in November, and I hope to run a full marathon in 2026!"
