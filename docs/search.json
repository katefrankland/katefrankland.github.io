This summer (2025), Iâ€™ll be moving to Redlands, California for an internship at ESRI. Afterward, Iâ€™ll return to Santa Barbara for Fall Quarter, and in February 2026, Iâ€™ll head to the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia to finish my undergraduate education. Iâ€™ll come back to Santa Barbara for graduation, and then hope to spend the next summer job hunting and exploring in New York City â€” a place Iâ€™ve dreamed of living since I was little. It is going to be completely out of my comfort zone, but am going to push through this and live life to the fullest while I still can."
